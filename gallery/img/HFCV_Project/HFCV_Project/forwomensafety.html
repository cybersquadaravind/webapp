                    The most frequent social media users worldwide are 15-year-old girls, and unfortunately, this
                    is also the age at which most girls report their first encounter with online harassment. While
                    young girls typically learn better strategies for managing online harassment as they age and
                    continue using social media, 42% of women’s behavioral response toward harassment is still
                    simply to ignore it.<br>
                    We have the right to feel safe in person, and we deserve to feel secure online. Protecting
                    yourself from social media harassment doesn’t mean you have to delete your accounts and
                    lose touch with your network, though.<br>
                    There are actually a lot of things you can do to protect yourself and still participate. Some

                    to leave your profile open on some sites and make it very private on others, but I highly

                    If you do want to share your location, do it after you’ve left or choose something more
                    general. For example, choose the city you’re in — not the neighborhood.

                    Nasty comments on pictures have become one of the biggest ways that women are abused
                    and harassed on the internet. Unfortunately, many people feel like a shared picture is an
                    invitation to share an (unasked for) opinion on a woman’s body, sexuality, clothing, and
                    more.<br>
                    Instagram is one of the worst places for this, but the sad fact is that Meta has acknowledged
                    that its apps are problematic and still does nothing about it. That means that, for now, the
                    burden is on us to do the best we can to protect ourselves.
                    And women don’t just have to worry about what they post on social media. We also have to
                    worry about what we send to people privately. Revenge porn, deep fakes, and just pictures
                    being shared with other people or websites without consent have become a huge problem.
                    There are no hard and fast rules about how to avoid issues with sharing pictures. There are
                    valid reasons for sharing personal moments in our lives and we shouldn’t have to lock
                    ourselves away in order to avoid being a victim. The good news is that there are things we
                    can do to mitigate harassment, while still being able to share our gorgeous photos.

                    Geotags indicate your location or the location in which a photo or video was taken. Sites like
                    Instagram and Facebook allow you to tag your photos with a location. When you add that
                    tag, anyone can see your picture when they search for that tag (unless your profile is locked
                    or private). Avoiding the use of geotags helps prevent online harassment from turning into
                    in-person conflict.<br>
                    If you do want to let people know where you are, you can add a geotag after you have left,

                    location), or restrict who can view any picture you’ve geotagged.

                    EXIF information is the information your camera stores about your photos. These details

                    Although it’s scrubbed by most social media sites and encrypted messaging apps, EXIF data

                    remove the location data before sharing — no matter how or what you’re sharing.

                    Needless to say, disappearing content is one of many methods aggressors use to harass
                    women online. Both Snapchat and Instagram have features where photos and videos
                    disappear after a certain amount of time. Because these messages and posts disappear,
                    people often send things through Snapchat or post stuff on their stories that they wouldn’t if it
                    were more permanent. However, abusers and harassers can still save them — either by
                    taking screenshots and screen recordings or taking a photo with another device.

                    Inappropriate and graphic comments and photos, catfishing, cyberstalking, and scams are
                    all common problems women encounter on messaging apps. The structure, features, and
                    privacy settings of each app somewhat indicate how difficult it is to confront harassment
                    when it occurs on the platform.<br>
                    Messaging apps like WhatsApp, Kik, and Discord are popular places for both old and new
                    friends, as they provide encrypted platforms that make communication instantaneous and
                    secure. Most messaging apps are more secure than SMS messaging, and this is attracting
                    billions of users to their platforms per year. Just like other online spaces, however,
                    messaging apps have a dark side and pose risks for users, especially young women.
                    Despite the risks involved in using any of these apps, messaging apps aren’t inherently bad.
                    So, don’t trash your messaging apps and go back to SMS messaging just yet. With the right
                    app and safety strategies, you can communicate confidently and put a stop to harassment
                    before it escalates.<br>
                    You’ll notice by now, though, that many of the best practices for one segment of online life
                    hold true for other virtual spaces as well. Practicing these strategies consistently across all
                    platforms is the strongest way to defend against cyber-harassment and take control of your
                    online presence.

                    While the most common forms of cyber harassment happen on social media, online
                    workplace harassment against women is also an issue. Since so much of our work
                    nowadays is done online, this problem has only gotten worse. You have a right to feel safe
                    and confident at work, even if your “work” is technically at your home office via Zoom, Slack,
                    or Microsoft Teams.<br>
                    People interact differently online, even coworkers you may actually know in person. The
                    anonymity people feel from behind the screen often empowers them to do things they
                    wouldn’t normally do in person. According to one study, 52% of women have experienced
                    harassment at work in the past year.<br>
                    The harassment women face in the virtual workplace has ranged from inappropriate
                    comments (verbal or text), unprofessional images or videos, threatening behavior, and
                    beyond. It can be difficult sometimes to know what counts as harassment. Some instances
                    of harassment are obvious, like Jeffrey Toobin’s masturbating on Zoom. Other examples
                    may not be so clear, like when Joe from marketing makes those slightly inappropriate jokes
                    to you in the meeting chat. A good rule of thumb is if you’re ever in professional situations
                    where you feel uncomfortable, start keeping a record.

                    Keeping a record of everything someone does to make you uncomfortable will only
                    strengthen your case. Every comment, email, or other inappropriate correspondence is
                    essential evidence, should the interactions have been intentional or persist. Keep
                    screenshots, log the dates and times of any incidents, and maintain a file of anything related
                    to your interactions with that person.<br>
                    ensure your other accounts are not revealing personal information to strangers. Your match
                    knowing you have other profiles will give them confidence that you are who you say you are,
                    but concealing your personal details beyond that will help keep you safe.

                    should feel bad about it at all. Women are in danger from men being abusive or violent after
                    being rejected and we need to prioritize our safety over anything else.<br>
                    all know that once something is online, there’s no guarantee it’s gone even if you delete it
                    later.

                    Keep careful records of harassment. Screenshots/photos,
                    videos/recordings, and logs are just a few ways to document evidence. This will become an
                    important safety net if you choose to seek assistance from law enforcement.
                    Never settle for default settings — If you make an online account, apart from signing up, the
                    first thing you should do is set up your privacy and security settings. Set them to your
                    comfort level, always erring on the side of caution when in doubt.
                    4.Go to the police — Online harassment, revenge porn, and doxxing are considered crimes
                    in many places. Just because something is happening on the internet, doesn’t mean that
                    you aren’t being (or won’t be) harmed in real life
