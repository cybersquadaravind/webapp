                            We are using social media to monitor activists and protestors, as well as for criminal

                            Social media surveillance refers to the collection and processing of personal data pulled
                            from digital communication platforms, often through automated technology that allows
                            for real-time aggregation, organization, and analysis of large amounts of metadata and
                            content. Broader in scope than spyware, which intercepts communications by targeting
                            specific individuals’ devices, social media surveillance cannot be dismissed as less
                            invasive. Billions of people around the world use these digital platforms to communicate
                            with loved ones, connect with friends and associates, and express their political, social,

                            Cyber-terrorists could utilize electronic communications to control destructive action
                            from afar, including attacks on the operation of water, electric, gas, telephone, television
                            and financial systems, interference with land and air transportation, and disruption of
                            communications between governments.
                            There are three ways in which computers can be used by terrorists and other criminals:
                            as a tool, as a receptacle of evidence, and as a target. One way to use computers as a
                            tool is to use them for disseminating propaganda. Terrorist also use computers and the
                            Internet for fund raising and intelligence gathering. Another way is flooding the system with emails or using any one of a number of
                            tools to cause the system to crash so that the legitimate user no longer has the capability
                            to use that system. Global connectivity is a factor that has increased the threat of
                            terrorism. Critical infrastructures are those surfaces that are so vital that their
                            destruction or debilitation would have a debilitating impact on the economic or national
                            security of the United States. The main reason that they are so vulnerable is because
                            they rely on computers for command, control, and communications.

                            Bank fraud is the use of potentially illegal means to obtain money, assets, or other
                            property owned or held by a financial institution, or to obtain money from depositors by
                            fraudulently posing as a bank or other financial institution. In many instances, bank fraud
                            is a criminal offence.

                        <p class="para">
                            First things first, we need to understand what an IP address actually is, or how will we
                            know how to track it?
                            IP stands for internet protocol, which is basically a set of rules that dictates how data is
                            sent across the internet. This might sound complicated, but honestly, it’s just a posh way
                            of explaining how different devices (like your computer or mine) communicate.
                            To be able to communicate, the internet will identify the IP address of your device. Your
                            IP address is the number assigned to your piece of hardware that allows other devices to
                            identify it. This works the same whether you’re using a laptop, mobile or tablet.
                            Websites also have IP addresses. This means that when you’re visiting a website, your
                            device will exchange its own IP address with that of the site to ensure data can be sent
                            and received between the two. It’s just the same as when you’re making a phone call or
                            sending an email, you need to have the necessary data in place for it to work.
                            But don’t worry, there’s nothing you need to do or set up. All devices that use the internet
                            are already programmed to follow internet protocol so they know how to engage with
                            each other. This keeps the internet functioning the way we need it to. Clever.
                            This is also what makes IP tracking possible. Since IP addresses are fully accessible in
                            order to facilitate communication between devices, tracking tools can gather the
                            information they need to analyse and record future movements. In other words, identify
                            who you are as a visitor and recognise you as you move through your journey on a
                            website.

                        <p class="para">
                            Ransomware is a type of malicious software (malware) that threatens to publish or
                            blocks access to data or a computer system, usually by encrypting it, until the victimpays a ransom fee to the attacker. In many cases, the ransom demand comes with a
                            deadline. If the victim doesn’t pay in time, the data is gone forever or the ransom
                            increases.
                            Ransomware attacks are all too common these days. Major companies in North America
                            and Europe alike have fallen victim to it. Cybercriminals will attack any consumer or any
                            business and victims come from all industries.
                            With more people working from home, threat actors increased their use of phishing.
                            Phishing is a primary starting point for ransomware infection. The phishing email targets
                            employees, both low-privileged users and high-privileged users. Email is inexpensive
                            and easy to use, so it makes a convenient way for attackers to spread ransomware.
                            Documents are normally passed in email, so users think nothing of opening a file in an
                            email attachment. The malicious macro runs, downloads ransomware to the local device,
                            and then delivers its payload. The ease of spreading ransomware in email is why it’s a
                            common malware attack

                            Though Internet has huge contribution to Society’s development; In recent time
                            Internet has been used by Criminals, Terrorists, and Hackers for mal-activities.
                            Open environments for Internet access such as publicly used Internet café’s and
                            university/school laboratories are becoming a platform for Criminals and newbie
                            Crackers. The major reason behind this is lack of proper authentication,insufficient logging & usage monitoring system in these environments. We
                            propose Internet Usage Monitoring for Crime Detection (IUMCD) system for
                            detection and prevention of criminal activities and intrusion attempts happening
                            from such open environments. The IUMCD is a proactive system which monitors
                            all User activities when User is accessing Internet from an open environment. We
                            observed that IUMCD system is able to detect and report many different types of
                            Criminal activities and Intrusion attempts while maintaining User’s private
                            information inaccessible to others.
